    <h1>Bad Day</h1>
    <p>
    Not every day<br>
    is a good day<br>
    for the elfin tailor.<br>
    Some days<br>
    the stolen cloth<br>
    reveals what it<br>
    was made for:<br>
    a handsome weskit<br>
    or the jerkin<br>
    of an elfin sailor.<br>
    Other days<br>
    the tailor<br>
    sees a jacket<br>
    in his mind<br>
    and sets about<br>
    to find the fabric.<br>
    But some days<br>
    neither the idea<br>
    nor the material<br>
    presents itself;<br>
    and these are <br>
    the hard days<br>
    for the tailor elf.
    </p>

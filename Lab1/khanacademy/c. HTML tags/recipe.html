<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>STEP 1:</strong> Put the ribs in a large bowl, season with sea salt and the ground white pepper. Add the garlic, yellow bean paste, shaoxing rice wine, and dark soy sauce to create a paste. Mix together well to combine, using your hands to work the marinade into the pork. Put it in the fridge, covered, for 20 mins to let the ribs marinate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>STEP 2:</strong> Heat a wok or heavy-based saucepan over high heat and fill just less than half-full with the groundnut oil. Heat to 180C or until a cube of bread dropped in turns golden brown in 30 secs. Drain the ribs of the marinade. Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully lower the ribs and shallow fry for 7-8 mins or until browned. Gently turn them to ensure even cooking. Once cooked, remove them and drain on kitchen paper. Do this in batches until all the ribs are cooked.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>STEP 3:</strong> In a small jug, combine all the ingredients for the sweet and sour sauce, mixing well with a fork or whisk and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>STEP 4:</strong> Put the wok or a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the ribs and pour in the sauce, cooking on medium heat for 5-6 mins or until the sauce has reduced to a sticky consistency. Garnish with the micro chives and serve immediately, accompanied with some stir-fried greens and jasmine rice, if you like.
    </li>
